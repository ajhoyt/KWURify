### About
Welcome to my first independent coding project! 

KWURify's goal is to create setlists for radio DJ's based on any given inspiration playlist that fit within the DJ's popularity and airtime constraints. For example, if a radio DJ has a one hour show, and does not want to play songs with over 10M+ streams or by artists with over 1M+ monthly listeners. 


**This project is still in progress as of the commit date. ** I look forward to completing very soon and would love to hear any advice you may have.
